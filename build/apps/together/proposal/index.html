<h2 id="ideation">Ideation</h2>
<p>​
These ideation questions are the same as before. Your answers should represent
the integration of creative ideas from every team member.
​</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the name of your app?
​
Jukebox
​</li>
<li>What collaborative activity can people do together using your app?
​
Guests at a party or group hangout decide by popular vote what music to listen to. Songs displayed on a Reddit style list where people can add songs and upvote or downvote songs. Highly ranked songs will eventually be played and low ranked songs will eventually be removed by the admin. There is also a discussion forum where people may or post general thoughts about what is being played. An admin is responsible for actually playing the music, selecting the song to play in case of a tie or no votes, and posting on the web app the current song being played and the song that is next up. (In future iterations, some of these things may be automated.) 
​</li>
<li>What is the ideal number of concurrent users (must be at least 10 but no more than 40)?
​
10 to 40 or however many friends at the party.
​</li>
<li>What skills do people need in order to do this activity?
​
People do not need any skills, only an enjoyment of music.
​</li>
<li>Is this activity for fun or for something practical?
​
This activity is primarily for fun to expand people’s roles at a party.
​</li>
<li>How can a person see what everyone else is doing?
​
People can see the all of the songs that have been suggested and their vote counts updated and rearranged in real time, all recent comments uploaded to the discussion thread, and information such as title and artist for the current song being played.
​</li>
<li>How can a person see the most recent result of everyone’s collaborative effort?
​
The most recent result of everyone’s collaboration is the current song being played and displayed on all devices. The discussion forum could be archived for people to find the song suggestions and thoughts of their peers.
​</li>
<li>What can an admin see (i.e., God’s mode)?
​
The admin has controls to display the current song, remove songs that have been played or have too many negative votes, view all users logged in. The admin may uniquely have access to a Spotify playlist being streamed that will be embedded in the web app.
​<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
​
For each person on the team, jot down a list of ideas credited to that person.
It’s okay to credit multiple people for the same idea. The rationale of this
section of the proposal is to demonstrate that everyone on the team contributes
useful ideas.

​<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
​
A reasonable way to implement a functional prototype of your together app
is to build upon the service-matching app (i.e. uber). Discuss what additional
efforts may be required from your team to develop the together app.
​</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What existing components of the uber app your team can reuse?
​
Login, user list for the admin to view, separate views for admin/user, form for submission.
​</li>
<li>What new components and features your team may need to build?
​
Voting System, self-organizing queue, discussion chat, controls for the admin.
​</li>
<li>What new skills your team will still need to acquire?
​
We will need to determine whether there is a way to embed an audio player in the app, and be careful to limit the admin login to only one person, and make sure to prevent people from voting more than once per song.
​<h2 id="what-s-next-">What’s Next?</h2>
​
This is a preliminary proposal. Next week, your team will receive feedback and
will work on building a <em>mockup</em> of this app. The week after that, your team
will start implementing the app.</li>
