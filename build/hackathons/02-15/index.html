<p>Date: 02-15-2016</p>
<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do two rounds of mini-demos to a small subset of the class</li>
<li>Make a plan to prepare for a live-demo to the entire class and guest judges in one-week time</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>Total time: 20 minutes (10 minutes per round x 2)</p>
<p>We will do two rounds of mini demos. Split your team into halves. During each round,
one half (presenters) will stay and present a demo.  The other half
(audience) will go to other teams to listen to their demos. The roles will switch
between rounds.</p>
<p>As presenters, the goal of a mini demo is to practice talking about your app to
an audience. What you want to talk about is up to you.</p>
<p>As audience, try to evenly distribute across the presenting teams so each team
has 3 or 4 audience members.</p>
<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
<p>Total Time: 30 minutes</p>
<p>Discuss among the team to come up with a plan to further develop your app in order
to</p>
<ul>
<li>Present a real live-demo (described in <a href="#what-s-next-">What’s Next</a>)</li>
<li>Respond to feedback (not all, just the most important ones)</li>
</ul>
<p>The format of the plan is up to you. Leverage the skills you’ve acquired from
previous CS classes (e.g., Tools and Methods).</p>
<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>
<p>Write your plan in <code>/apps/uber/demo/plan.md</code> which will generate <a href="/apps/uber/demo/plan.html"><code>/apps/uber/demo/plan.html</code></a>. Publish your plan by
deploying the update to the Firebase.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What’s Next?</h2>
<p>Next Monday (2-22), we will organize a live-demo event. Each team will have a chance to present this prototype to the whole class and to a panel of judges.</p>
<p>The flow of the demo is described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each member should take on one (or two if the team size is small)
of the following roles:<ul>
<li>One person will deliver an elevator pitch</li>
<li>One person will demo the <em>client</em> screen</li>
<li>One person will demo the <em>admin</em> screen</li>
<li>One person will demo the Firebase data models</li>
<li>One person will discuss what feedback has been incorporated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meanwhile, everyone in the audience will visit the app and try to<ul>
<li>login</li>
<li>change locations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like a typical hackathon, we will select people’s and judges’ award winners.</p>
